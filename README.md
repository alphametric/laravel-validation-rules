# Axiom

This package provides a library of reusable validation rules for your Laravel projects. Use them to augment the existing set provided by Laravel itself.

Axiom is a re-release of the original `alphametric/laravel-validation-rules` package, which was also created by myself. This new version includes a rewrite to support PHP 7.4+ and also includes type hinting as well as some additional refactoring.

## Installation

Pull in the package using composer

```bash
composer require mattkingshott/axiom
```

## Upgrading

Axiom includes several breaking changes from the original package, so you'll need to follow these steps if you were using the old version:

1. Ensure that you are using PHP 7.4 or later.
2. Remove `alphametric/laravel-validation-rules` from your `composer.json` file.
3. Run `composer update` to remove the package from your `vendor` directory.
4. Install Axiom by running `composer require mattkingshott/axiom`.
5. Replace all instances of `use Alphametric\Validation` with `use Axiom`.
6. The `EndsWith` rule has been removed as Laravel now natively supports this.
7. The `Equals` rule has been removed. Instead, you should use Laravel's native `in` rule with a single option.
8. The `DoesNotExist` rule has been renamed to `Missing`.

## Usage

As per the Laravel [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#using-rule-objects), simply import the relevant validation class wherever you require it, and then include it within the rules for a particular field:

```php
use Axiom\Rules\StrongPassword;

// ...

$request->validate([
    'password' => ['bail', 'required', new StrongPassword],
]);
```

**IMPORTANT**: As with all custom rules, you cannot use a pipe-delimited string. You must instead use an `array` e.g.

```php
'password' => ['bail', 'required', new StrongPassword] // correct
'password' => 'bail|required|new StrongPassword'       // wrong
```

If the validation fails, the package will attempt to respond with a localized error message (see message keys below). If the key does not exist, it will fall back to a hard-coded English language version.

## Available rules
